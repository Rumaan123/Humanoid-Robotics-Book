# Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### Technical Accuracy
All content must be factually correct, verified against official documentation, primary sources, or peer-reviewed research. Every technical claim must be substantiated with credible evidence and traceable to authoritative sources.

### Clarity & Precision
Explanations must be concise, structured, and understandable for readers with a computer science or software engineering background. Content must be logically organized with clear progression from concepts to implementation.

### Reproducibility
All code examples, commands, and procedures must execute successfully as provided; results should be fully reproducible. Every technical demonstration must be tested and validated to ensure reader success.

### Rigor & Reliability
Prefer authoritative sources, primary references, and peer-reviewed material; clearly identify assumptions or speculative statements. All content must meet academic standards for technical publications.

### Consistency
Terminology, formatting, and style must be uniform across the book to maintain professional quality. All chapters must follow the same structural patterns, citation formats, and presentation standards.

### Originality & Attribution
All content must be original with zero tolerance for plagiarism; all external sources must be properly cited in APA or Markdown-compatible format. Code examples must follow best practices and include necessary comments for clarity.

## Technical Standards

- **Source Verification**: Every factual claim must be traceable to credible sources
- **Citation Format**: APA style or Markdown-compatible references with minimum 50% authoritative or peer-reviewed sources
- **Code Standards**: All code examples must follow best practices, be commented where necessary, and run without errors
- **Readability**: Aim for Flesch-Kincaid grade 10–12 readability while maintaining technical depth
- **Format Requirements**: Markdown for Docusaurus, including proper headings, subheadings, code blocks, and embedded citations

## Development Workflow

- **Content Structure**: Chapters: 1,000–2,500 words; Total book: 15,000–25,000 words
- **Source Requirements**: Minimum 20 sources recommended for the full book
- **Quality Gates**: All content must be fact-checked, verified, and traceable before publication
- **Style Guide**: Follow professional technical book conventions, including examples, diagrams, and structured explanations
- **Platform Compatibility**: Content must be optimized for Docusaurus and deployment on GitHub Pages

## Compliance Requirements

- **Content Verification**: All technical content must be validated against official documentation or primary sources
- **Code Validation**: All code examples must run successfully with expected output
- **Academic Integrity**: Zero plagiarism tolerance with proper attribution for all external sources
- **Accessibility**: Content must be accessible and comprehensible to target audience
- **Deployment Readiness**: Final content must be ready for deployment on GitHub Pages via Docusaurus

## Governance

This constitution governs all aspects of the Humanoid Robotics Book project. All contributors must adhere to these principles. Amendments require documentation of changes, approval from project maintainers, and a migration plan for existing content. All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with these principles before merging.
