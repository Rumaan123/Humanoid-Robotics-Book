# Quickstart Guide: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## Overview
This quickstart guide provides a high-level introduction to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project, designed to help contributors understand the structure, goals, and contribution process.

## Project Goals
- Create a comprehensive resource on Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Bridge the gap between digital AI models and physical humanoid robot systems
- Provide conceptual and architectural understanding without implementation details
- Support the four official course modules with structured content
- Deploy via Docusaurus on GitHub Pages

## Target Audience
- Advanced AI and robotics students
- Software engineers entering Physical AI and robotics
- Technical educators and curriculum designers

## Book Structure
The book is organized into four core modules that follow a logical progression:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Focus: Middleware and communication infrastructure
- Core concepts: nodes, topics, services, actions
- Tools: ROS 2, rclpy, URDF

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Focus: Simulation and virtual environments
- Core concepts: physics simulation, sensor simulation, visualization
- Tools: Gazebo, Unity

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
- Focus: Perception and navigation
- Core concepts: computer vision, VSLAM, path planning
- Tools: Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- Focus: Cognitive interaction and integration
- Core concepts: LLM integration, voice-to-action, multi-modal interaction
- Tools: LLMs, ROS 2 action interfaces

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Content Creation
- Create content following the constitutional principles (accuracy, clarity, reproducibility)
- Use conceptual and architectural focus without implementation details
- Reference authoritative sources (minimum 50% peer-reviewed or official documentation)
- Format content in Markdown compatible with Docusaurus

### 2. Quality Standards
- Ensure all technical claims are verified against authoritative sources
- Maintain consistency in terminology across modules
- Follow APA citation style for all references
- Target Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12 readability

### 3. File Structure
- Organize content in the `docs/` directory following the module structure
- Each module has its own subdirectory with topic-specific files
- Use descriptive but concise filenames
- Include appropriate metadata in Markdown files

## Technical Requirements
- Content must be in Markdown format
- Compatible with Docusaurus documentation framework
- Deployable on GitHub Pages
- Minimum 15,000 words, maximum 25,000 words total
- Minimum 20 authoritative sources across the book

## Getting Started
1. Review the constitutional principles for content quality
2. Choose a module and topic to work on from the planned structure
3. Research authoritative sources for your topic
4. Create your content following the quality standards
5. Submit for review and incorporate feedback

## Review Process
- All content must be fact-checked and verified
- Technical accuracy verified against official documentation
- Clarity and readability reviewed by domain experts
- Consistency with constitutional principles confirmed
